This is the Readme file for the submission for user 505591.
This contains the client called location and the server called location server:

Lab 1: I pass all 28 tests for the basic client. 
Lab 2: I pass all basic tests and then pass 5 of the extended tests but have 3 nonfatal not passing. 
Lab 3: I pass 19 tests but fail one nonfatal; test number 18.
Lab 4: I pass the first 10 tests, but from 11 onwards my program crashes. I have tried debugging this and have come to the conclusion that on line 247 in my location server, the name is being set to newSections[1]
	where two sections might not be returned causing this error but I couldn't work out how to fix this. 
Lab 5: I decided to attampt lab 5 and manage to pass test 1, but then do not pass test 2 but after debugging I have found that it completes 9 threads but crashes on the 10th.
